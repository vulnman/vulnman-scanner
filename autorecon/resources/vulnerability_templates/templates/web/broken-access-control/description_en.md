The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:

- Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)
- Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and
- Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed) 

An absence or misconfiguration in these protection mechanisms allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive data.
