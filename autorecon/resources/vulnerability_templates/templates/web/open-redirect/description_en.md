An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. 
By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. 

Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.
